Scripts need to be made executable before you can use them.
Some are useful programs, config files,
others are just toys to be discarded.

It is also more portable and efficient to use #!/bin/sh instead
of other shells like bash or fish.
Makes it more universal since most computers are shipped with sh
even when they don't have bash.

Oh and you also need to fix the last line of your ~/.profile,
to map that Ctrl_R button to Mod4.
