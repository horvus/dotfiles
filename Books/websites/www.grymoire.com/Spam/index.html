<p> This page lists anti-spam tool(s) developed by Bruce Barnett.
<br>

<ul>
<li><a href="FF.pl">FF - Find Friends</a> or <a href="FF.pl.txt">FF (Text)</a>- Give this a list of
hostnames and/or URL's, and it will look up the associated names,
aliases, IP addresses, name servers, and mail servers. If a URL is
given, it will extract the host name and do the above. It will also
query the URL, looking for additional URL's and hostnames to add to
the search. The program will then recurse through the list again
(limited by the -# argument) and repeat the process. When done, the
program will print the results sorted by IP address, and report wich
of these IP addresses are blocklisted, and on which list.

<br> Therefore this program is designed to find ISP's that provide
support for spammers. The new version has improved HTTP scanning, and
a mechanism to not scan specific addresses, like w3.org, perl.org,
etc.

<br>As an example output, here is a list of addresses I've seen in
spam: <a href="http:Webfinity.www">Webfinity.www</a> <br> the command
<br>cat Webfinity.www | FF.pl -T10 -x 
<br>
I am generating the results weekly and placing it on my web page. I am dedicating this tool to the Python Video/Webfinity spammers, without whom this tool would not have been written.
The weekly results of the query be seen 
<a href="http:Webfinity.www.out">here</a> 


<br><br>Here is a second list, using this file as input <a href="http:Webfinity.list">Webfinity.list</a> which was the list of all of the hosts sharing the same address - 216.130.213.253 - on Jan 28/2006.
The output can be seen <a href="http:Webfinity.list.out">here</a> 
<br><br>

<br><br>ISRAEL FAGBEMI has been sending out USENET spam, and I'm tired of it. I added his list of domains found <a href="http:Vosar.net">here</a> 
and once a week I feed this into my Find Friends program to find out who is affiliated with this spammer.
<br> 
The output - which shows a lot of people affiliated with this spammer - can be seen  <a href="http:Vosar.net.out">here</a> 
<br>

<br>Note that the results tends to change as the spammers hop around
from one ISP to another.  So the results given above are temporary.
<br>
Also note that this is just a diagnostic tool which I have found
useful in the past. Sites unrelated to the spam often show up. A
spammer can reference any other site on their web page, and falsely
implicate a relationshiop. Use common sense.


Also - the <a href="FF.pl">FF</a> spider uses the file $HOME/.ff to list domains that are "trusted" or rather - if found, the spider won't examing those pages. The file I use can be found <a href="ff.txt">here</a> but you have to rename it for your machine.

<li><a href="FF.rev1.pl">FF - Find Friends (Old) </a> - Older version
</ul>
