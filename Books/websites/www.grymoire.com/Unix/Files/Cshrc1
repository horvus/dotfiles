# Sample .cshrc file

# This part is executed on the following occasions:
#	1. "rsh machine command"
#	2. "csh scriptname"
#	3. All scripts that start with #!/bin/csh (without -f)	
# Read the minimum .cshrc file, if there

if ( -f ~/.cshrc.min ) source ~/.cshrc.min

# if run as a script, then $?prompt == 0
# if run as a remote shell, then $?prompt == 0 && $?term == 0
# if $USER is not defined, then "~" doesn't have the proper value
#     so bail out in this case

if ( ! ( $?USER && $?prompt && $?TERM )) exit

# This is an interactive shell

# examples:
#     set noclobber
#     set myvariable = "value"
#     set mylist = ( a b c d e f g)
