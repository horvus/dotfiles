<h1 id="autocommands">Autocommands</h1>
<p>Now we're going to look at a topic almost as important as mappings:
autocommands.</p>
<p>Autocommands are a way to tell Vim to run certain commands whenever certain
events happen.  Let's dive right into an example.</p>
<p>Open a new file with <code>:edit foo</code> and close it right away with <code>:quit</code>.  Look on
your hard drive and you'll notice that the file is not there.  This is because
Vim doesn't actually <em>create</em> the file until you save it for the first time.</p>
<p>Let's change it so that Vim creates files as soon as you edit them.  Run the
following command:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-vim">:autocmd BufNewFile * :write</code></pre>


<p>This is a lot to take in, but try it out and see that it works.  Run <code>:edit foo</code>
again, close it with <code>:quit</code>, and look at your hard drive.  This time the file
will be there (and empty, of course).</p>
<p>You'll have to close Vim to remove the autocommand.  We'll talk about how to
avoid this in a later chapter.</p>
<h2 id="autocommand-structure">Autocommand Structure</h2>
<p>Let's take a closer look at the autocommand we just created:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-text">:autocmd BufNewFile * :write
         ^          ^ ^
         |          | |
         |          | The command to run.
         |          |
         |          A "pattern" to filter the event.
         |
         The "event" to watch for.</code></pre>


<p>The first piece of the command is the type of event we want to watch for.  Vim
offers <em>many</em> events to watch.  Some of them include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Starting to edit a file that doesn't already exist.</li>
<li>Reading a file, whether it exists or not.</li>
<li>Switching a buffer's <code>filetype</code> setting.</li>
<li>Not pressing a key on your keyboard for a certain amount of time.</li>
<li>Entering insert mode.</li>
<li>Exiting insert mode.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is just a tiny sample of the available events.  There are many more you can
use to do lots of interesting things.</p>
<p>The next part of the command is a "pattern" that lets you be more specific about
when you want the command to fire.  Start up a new Vim instance and run the
following command:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-vim">:autocmd BufNewFile *.txt :write</code></pre>


<p>This is almost the same as the last command, but this time it will only apply to
files whose names end in <code>.txt</code>.</p>
<p>Try it out by running <code>:edit bar</code>, then <code>:quit</code>, then <code>:edit bar.txt</code>, then
<code>:quit</code>.  You'll see that Vim writes the <code>bar.txt</code> automatically, but <em>doesn't</em>
write <code>bar</code> because it doesn't match the pattern.</p>
<p>The final part of the command is the command we want to run when the event
fires.  This is pretty self-explanatory, except for one catch: you can't use
special characters like <code>&lt;cr&gt;</code> in the command.  We'll talk about how to get
around this limitation later in the book, but for now you'll just have to live
with it.</p>
<h2 id="another-example">Another Example</h2>
<p>Let's define another autocommand, this time using a different event.  Run the
following command:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-vim">:autocmd BufWritePre *.html :normal gg=G</code></pre>


<p>We're getting a bit ahead of ourselves here because we're going to talk about
<code>normal</code> later in the book, but for now you'll need to bear with me because it's
tough to come up with useful examples at this point.</p>
<p>Create a new file called <code>foo.html</code>.  Edit it with Vim and enter the following
text <em>exactly</em>, including the whitespace:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-html">&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Hello!&lt;/p&gt;
                 &lt;/body&gt;
                  &lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>


<p>Now save this file with <code>:w</code>.  What happened?  Vim seems to have reindented the
file for us before saving it!</p>
<p>For now I want you to trust me that running <code>:normal gg=G</code> will tell Vim to
reindent the current file.  Don't worry about how that works just yet.</p>
<p>What we <em>do</em> want to pay attention to is the autocommand.  The event type is
<code>BufWritePre</code>, which means the event will be checked just before you write <em>any</em>
file.</p>
<p>We used a pattern of <code>*.html</code> to ensure that this command will only fire when
we're working on files that end in <code>.html</code>.  This lets us target our
autocommands at specific files, which is a very powerful idea that we'll
continue to explore later on.</p>
<h2 id="multiple-events">Multiple Events</h2>
<p>You can create a single autocommand bound to <em>multiple</em> events by separating the
events with a comma.  Run this command:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-vim">:autocmd BufWritePre,BufRead *.html :normal gg=G</code></pre>


<p>This is almost like our last command, except it will also reindent the code
whenever we <em>read</em> an HTML file as well as when we write it.  This could be
useful if you have coworkers that don't indent their HTML nicely.</p>
<p>A common idiom in Vim scripting is to pair the <code>BufRead</code> and <code>BufNewFile</code> events
together to run a command whenever you open a certain kind of file, regardless
of whether it happens to exist already or not.  Run the following command:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-vim">:autocmd BufNewFile,BufRead *.html setlocal nowrap</code></pre>


<p>This will turn line wrapping off whenever you're working on an HTML file.</p>
<h2 id="filetype-events">FileType Events</h2>
<p>One of the most useful events is the <code>FileType</code> event.  This event is fired
whenever Vim sets a buffer's <code>filetype</code>.</p>
<p>Let's set up a few useful mappings for a variety of file types.  Run the
following commands:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-vim">:autocmd FileType javascript nnoremap &lt;buffer&gt; &lt;localleader&gt;c I//&lt;esc&gt;
:autocmd FileType python     nnoremap &lt;buffer&gt; &lt;localleader&gt;c I#&lt;esc&gt;</code></pre>


<p>Open a Javascript file (a file that ends in <code>.js</code>), pick a line and type
<code>&lt;localleader&gt;c</code>.  This will comment out the line.</p>
<p>Now open a Python file (a file that ends in <code>.py</code>), pick a line and type
<code>&lt;localleader&gt;c</code>.  This will comment out the line, but it will use Python's
comment character!</p>
<p>Using autocommands alongside the buffer-local mappings we learned about in the
last chapter we can create mappings that are specific to the type of file that
we're editing.</p>
<p>This reduces the load on our minds when we're coding.  Instead of having to
think about moving to the beginning of the line and adding a comment character
we can simply think "comment this line".</p>
<h2 id="exercises">Exercises</h2>
<p>Skim <code>:help autocmd-events</code> to see a list of all the events you can bind
autocommands to.  You don't need to memorize each one right now.  Just try to
get a feel for the kinds of things you can do.</p>
<p>Create a few <code>FileType</code> autocommands that use <code>setlocal</code> to set options for your
favorite filetypes just the way you like them.  Some options you might like to
change on a per-filetype basis are <code>wrap</code>, <code>list</code>, <code>spell</code>, and <code>number</code>.</p>
<p>Create a few more "comment this line" autocommands for filetypes you work with
often.</p>
<p>Add all of these autocommands to your <code>~/.vimrc</code> file.  Use your shortcut
mappings for editing and sourcing it quickly, of course!</p></div>
