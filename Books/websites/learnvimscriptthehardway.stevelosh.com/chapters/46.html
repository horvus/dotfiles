<h1 id="advanced-syntax-highlighting">Advanced Syntax Highlighting</h1>
<p>So far we've defined some simple syntax highlighting for Potion files: keywords
and functions.</p>
<p>If you didn't do the exercises in the last chapter, you need to go back and do
them.  I'm going to assume you did them.</p>
<p>In fact, you should go back and do <em>any</em> exercises you skipped.  Even if you
think you don't need them, you <em>need</em> to do them for this book to be effective.
Please trust me on this.</p>
<h2 id="highlighting-comments">Highlighting Comments</h2>
<p>One obvious part of Potion that we need to highlight is comments.  The problem
is that Potion comments start with <code>#</code> which is (almost always) not in
<code>iskeyword</code>.</p>
<p>If you don't know what <code>iskeyword</code> means, you didn't listen to me.  Go back and
<em>do the damn exercises</em>.  I'm not just throwing useless busywork at you when
I write the exercises for each chapter.  You <em>really</em> need to do them to
understand the book.</p>
<p>Because <code>#</code> isn't a keyword character we need to use a regular expression to
match it (and the rest of the comment).  We'll do this with <code>syntax match</code>
instead of <code>syntax keyword</code>.  Add the following lines to your syntax file:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-vim">syntax match potionComment "\v#.*$"
highlight link potionComment Comment</code></pre>


<p>I'm not going to tell you where to put them in the file any more.  You're
a programmer: use your judgement.</p>
<p>Close and reopen <code>factorial.pn</code>.  Add a comment somewhere in the file and you'll
see that it's highlighted as a comment.</p>
<p>The second line is simple: it tells Vim to highlight anything in the
<code>potionComment</code> syntax group as a <code>Comment</code>.</p>
<p>The first line is something new.  We use <code>syntax match</code> which tells Vim to match
<em>regexes</em> instead of literal keywords.</p>
<p>Notice that the regular expression we're using starts with <code>\v</code> which tells Vim
to use "very magic" mode.  Reread the chapter on basic regular expressions if
you're not sure what that means.</p>
<p>In this particular case the "very magic" mode isn't necessary.  But in the
future we might change this regex and wonder why it's not working, so I'd
recommend <em>always</em> using "very magic" regexes for consistency.</p>
<p>As for the regex itself, it's fairly simple: comments start with a hash and
include all characters from there to the end of the line.</p>
<p>If you need a refresher course on regular expressions you should take a look at
<a href="http://regex.learncodethehardway.org/">Learn Regex the Hard Way</a> by Zed Shaw.</p>
<h2 id="highlighting-operators">Highlighting Operators</h2>
<p>Another part of Potion we need regexes to highlight is operators.  Add the
following to your syntax file:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-vim">syntax match potionOperator "\v\*"
syntax match potionOperator "\v/"
syntax match potionOperator "\v\+"
syntax match potionOperator "\v-"
syntax match potionOperator "\v\?"
syntax match potionOperator "\v\*\="
syntax match potionOperator "\v/\="
syntax match potionOperator "\v\+\="
syntax match potionOperator "\v-\="

highlight link potionOperator Operator</code></pre>


<p>Close and reopen <code>factorial.pn</code>.  Notice that the <code>*=</code> in the factorial function
is now highlighted.</p>
<p>The first thing you probably noticed about this hunk of code is that I put each
regex on its own line instead of grouping them like I did with keywords.  This
is because <code>syntax match</code> does <em>not</em> support multiple groups on a single line.</p>
<p>You should also note that I used <code>\v</code> at the beginning of every regular
expression, even when it wasn't strictly necessary.  I prefer to keep my regex
syntax consistent when writing Vimscript, even if it means a few extra
characters.</p>
<p>You might be wondering why I didn't use a regex like <code>"\v-\=?"</code> to match both
<code>-</code> <em>and</em> <code>-=</code> in one line.  You can absolutely do that if you want to.  It will
work just fine.  I just tend to think of <code>-</code> and <code>-=</code> as separate operators, so
I put them on separate lines.</p>
<p>Defining those operators as separate matches simplifies the regexes at the cost
of some extra verbosity.  I prefer doing it like that, but you may feel
differently.  Use your judgement.</p>
<p>I also never defined <code>=</code> as an operator.  We'll do that in a second, but
I wanted to avoid it for now so I could teach you a lesson.</p>
<p>Because I used separate regexes for <code>-</code> and <code>-=</code> I had to define <code>-=</code> <em>after</em>
<code>-</code>!</p>
<p>If I did it in the opposite order and used <code>-=</code> in a Potion file, Vim would
match <code>-</code> (and highlight it, of course) and only <code>=</code> would remain for matching.
This shows when you're building groups with <code>syntax match</code> each group "consumes"
pieces of the file that can't be matched later.</p>
<p>This is an oversimplification, but I don't want to get bogged down in the
details just yet.  For now, your rule of thumb should be to match larger groups
after smaller groups later because groups defined <em>later</em> have priority over
groups defined <em>earlier</em>.</p>
<p>Let's go ahead and add <code>=</code> as an operator, now that we've had our lesson:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-vim">syntax match potionOperator "\v\="</code></pre>


<p>Take a second and think about where you need to put this in the syntax file.
Reread the last few paragraphs if you need a hint.</p>
<h2 id="exercises">Exercises</h2>
<p>Read <code>:help syn-match</code>.</p>
<p>Read <code>:help syn-priority</code>.</p>
<p>We didn't make <code>:</code> an operator in our example.  Read the Potion docs and make
a conscious decision about whether to make <code>:</code> an operator.  If you decide to do
so, add it to the syntax file.</p>
<p>Do the same for <code>.</code> and <code>/</code>.</p>
<p>Add a syntax group <code>potionNumber</code> that highlights numbers.  Link it to the
highlight group <code>Number</code>.  Remember that Potion supports numbers like <code>2</code>,
<code>0xffaf</code>, <code>123.23</code>, <code>1e-2</code>, and <code>1.9956e+2</code>.  Remember to balance the time it
takes to handle edge cases with the amount of time those edge cases will
actually be used.</p></div>
