  <h1>About This Manual</h1>
<p>This manual was written during a Book Sprint sponsored by Google and facilitated by FLOSS Manuals. The manual was written in two days but the maintenance of the manual is an ongoing process to which you may wish to contribute. A second sprint occurred in 2010 to update the manual (adding the Org Admin section) and to write the Students Guide ("Flipping Bits not Burgers").</p>
<p>An update of the manual was done in January 2017 and what was quite impressive is how few changes had to be made as all of the advice the original authors of this manual still stand today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the manual may be updated at any time, you may wish to periodically check here for updated versions: <br /><a href="http://www.flossmanuals.net/" target="_blank">http://www.flossmanuals.net</a></p>
<p>You can also find the electronic book (for use with Android ebook readers software, Sony Reader etc) here: <br /><a href="http://objavi.flossmanuals.net/books/" target="_blank">http://objavi.flossmanuals.net/books/</a></p>
