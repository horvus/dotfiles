  <p>Audacity: MenuBar</p>
<h1>Menu Bar</h1>
<p><strong>Software name : </strong>Audacity <strong></strong> <br /><strong>Software version :</strong>&nbsp;2.2</p>
<p>Lets look at the basic elements of the Audacity Menu Bar :</p>
<p><img src="static/Audacity menu bar.png" alt="" width="466" height="29" /></p>
<p>The <strong>Menu Bar</strong> is a typical element in many applications. It will look slightly different to this if you are not using <strong>Windows</strong>; most notably in <strong>Mac OSX</strong> this Menu Bar is not located on the application window itself but at the top of the screen in the "Apple Menu".&nbsp; Let's go through the Menu Bar one item at a time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>File</h2>
<p>By clicking on "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">F</span>ile" in the Menu Bar you get a drop down menu with numerous options to choose from. As with other drop-downs in the menu bar, some options here may be "greyed out," meaning you can't select them; you will only be able to choose the options that appear in solid black. The options available depend on the state of your Audacity project at the time. For example the following image of the File drop-down displays when Audacity has just been opened and no recording or editing has yet been started (thus no audio tracks are displayed in the GUI).&nbsp; As in subsequent menus from the menu bar (see below), a '&gt;' symblol following the option name indicates that a submenu will appear, with more specific options or functions:</p>
<p><img src="static/Audacity file menu.png" alt="" width="217" height="305" /></p>
<p>The File Menu is where you can add, import and export all the things related to the audio and project (.aup) files.</p>
<table cellpadding="3">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong><em>option</em></strong></td>
<td><strong><em>action</em></strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>New</td>
<td>creates a new empty project window.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Open...</td>
<td>selecting "Open" presents you with a dialog where you can choose a file to open. Note: if you choose any type of audio file other than an Audacity project file (.aup), you are essentially 'importing' it, as in "Import" below, except that any changes made will be saved to the original file.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Recent Files</td>
<td>Shows the ten most recent .aup or other audio files you have opened.</td>
</tr>

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2>Select</h2>
<p>The <strong>Select</strong> <strong>menu</strong> provides commands for defining selection regions within your project (which you can then edit, delete, export or apply various effects to in other menus).&nbsp; These functions can save time and be much more precise than selecting a region manually via your mouse cursor.</p>

<h2>Effect</h2>
<p>The <strong>Effect Menu</strong> allows you to apply a wide (potentially infinite) range of effects to a selected audio track or region. Note that this menu cannot be accessed while any tracks are in Playback or Record mode.</p>
<p><img src="static/Audacity effects menu.png" alt="" width="289" height="765" /></p>
<p>Note that the menu pictured here represents the default effects plug-ins in Audacity as of the 2.2.1 release (and there are a dozen more below those pictured in the menu here).&nbsp; &nbsp;The following table addresses only some of the most familiar effects from among those available.&nbsp; Within and beyond this set, you are encouraged to experiment.</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong><em>name</em></strong></td>
<td><strong><em>action</em></strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Add/Remove Plug-in...</td>
<td>Functions just like the 'Add/Remove Plug-in..." feature of the Generate menu (and Analyze menu).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Repeat Last Effect</td>
<td>Applies the most recently-used effect to a new selected track or region.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Amplify</td>
<td>this effect increases or decreases the volume of a track or set of tracks.&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td rowspan="1">Bass Boost</td>
<td rowspan="1">this is a smooth filter which can amplify the lower frequencies while leaving most of the other frequencies alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Change Pitch</td>
<td>changes the pitch/frequency of the selected audio without changing the tempo.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td rowspan="1">Change Speed</td>
<td rowspan="1">changes the speed of the audio by resampling. Making the speed higher will also increase the pitch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td rowspan="1">Change Tempo</td>
<td rowspan="1">changes the tempo (speed) of the audio without changing the pitch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td rowspan="1">Click Removal</td>
<td rowspan="1">this effect is designed to remove the annoying clicks on recordings from vinyl records without damaging the rest of the audio.&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Distortion</td>
<td>applies a distortion effect familiar from much mid- and late-1960s rock music.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td rowspan="1">Compressor</td>
<td rowspan="1">compresses the dynamic range of the selection so that the loud parts are softer while keeping the volume of the soft parts the same.&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td rowspan="1">Echo</td>
<td rowspan="1">this effect repeats the audio you have selected again and again, softer each time. There is a fixed time delay between each repeat.&nbsp; Effect frequently used for vocal sounds in live performance (and guitar sounds for some groups like The Who).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td rowspan="1">Equalization</td>
<td rowspan="1">boost or reduce frequencies.&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td rowspan="1">Fade In</td>
<td rowspan="1">applies a linear fade-in to the selected audio.&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td rowspan="1">Fade Out</td>
<td rowspan="1">applies a linear fade-out to the selected audio.&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td rowspan="1">Invert</td>
<td rowspan="1">this effect flips the audio samples upside-down. This normally does not affect the sound of the audio at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Noise Removal</td>
<td>this effect is ideal for removing constant background noise such as fans, tape noise, or hums. It will not work very well for removing talking or music in the background.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td rowspan="1">Normalize</td>
<td rowspan="1">allows you to amplify such that the maximum amplitude is a fixed amount, -3 dB.&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td rowspan="1">Nyquist Prompt</td>
<td rowspan="1">allows you to express arbitrary transormations using a powerful functional programming language (for advanced users).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td rowspan="1">Phaser</td>
<td rowspan="1">the name "Phaser" comes from "Phase Shifter", because it works by combining phase-shifted signals with the original signal.&nbsp; Much 1970s rock music makes heavy use of phasing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td rowspan="1">Repeat</td>
<td rowspan="1">repeats the selection a certain number of times.&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td rowspan="1">Reverse</td>
<td rowspan="1">this effect reverses the selected audio.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td rowspan="1">Wahwah</td>
<td rowspan="1">
<p>just like a guitar's wah-wah peddle.&nbsp;</p>
</td>
</tr>

<p>In addition to these and other effects available by default from the Effect menu, many other effect plug-ins are available as <a title="effects documentation" href="http://manual.audacityteam.org/man/effect_menu_nyquist.html">Nyquist effects</a>,&nbsp;<a title="effects documentation" href="http://manual.audacityteam.org/man/effect_menu_ladspa.html">LADSPA effects</a>,&nbsp;<a title="effects documentation" href="http://manual.audacityteam.org/man/effect_menu_lv2.html">LV2 effects</a>, and&nbsp;<a title="effects documentation" href="http://manual.audacityteam.org/man/effect_menu_vst.html">VST effects</a>.&nbsp; Beyond the specific links supplied here, referencing these different groups of effects, see Audacity's overall&nbsp;<a title="effects documentation" href="http://manual.audacityteam.org/man/effect_menu.html">effects documentation</a> page.&nbsp; As noted there, some effects do not support the 'Preview' function, which allows you to preview the result of applying an effect to an audio track before applying it permanently.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Analyze</h2>
<p>The Analyze Menu gives you many options for finding out about the characteristics of your audio tracks, and labeling key features.&nbsp; The five default Audacity plug-ins shown at the bottom of the menu, but many more plug-ins are available.&nbsp; Rather than modifying your audio tracks, as in Effect functions, Analyze functions typically create a new label track indicating the audio features you are seeking. These labels can then be used for export or edit functions or for mixing.</p>
