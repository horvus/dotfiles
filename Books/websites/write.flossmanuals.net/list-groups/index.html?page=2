	   <li><a href="/groups/top-5-interview-questions-mostly-asked-at-work/">Top 5 Interview Questions Mostly asked at Work</a><span class="group-description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just like its mandatory to pass an aptitude test to get admission in any academic institution, to pass the driving test for getting a license; similarly, it is also mandatory to pass the interview to get an in-house dignified job. When it comes to feeling concern about interview questions, then beginners often need the guidance as they mostly seem twiddling fingers while waiting to get called for an interview.
 What makes them anxious is how to introduce themselves to the employers in such a convincing way that they caught employer’s attention, and come into a positive light. “What they might ask, and how to satisfy them?” .. .alike this, other thoughts pop up in their mind; thus making them exasperating.
 In this article, we’ll guide you how to get prepared for the most significant part of your career. This post contains a list of few top genuine questions that are often asked in an interview, and how you’re supposed to answer them. Your responses will be stronger if you prepare in advance, know what to expect during the interview, and have a sense of what you want to play up during your interview.
Have a look at the following top interview questions every employer ask;
1.    Tell me about yourself
Start with introducing yourself, the country or place you belong, tell about your sibling. The purpose of sharing your bit of personal information is to let the employer know to which class of family you belong in terms of qualification, and profession.
 It does not mean to dive deep into your life story, neither hiring manager is interested in knowing at which apartment or hospital you were born. 
2.    What is your greatest Strength &amp; Weakness? 
Strenght
While displaying your most noteworthy qualities, it&#39;s imperative to talk about the characteristics that will qualify you for the particular employment and set you apart from alternate competitors.
 Highlight a strength that is crucial to the position. Try to give an average or middle statement rather being overly modest, or pretending yourself a Superman. 
Find out from your company research and from the job description what strengths the company puts a lot of stock into. Don’t name a strength that is irrelevant to the job at hand.

Weakness
When it comes to disclosing your weak points, the situation becomes topsy – turvy at times as apart from telling your strong skills, you smartly have to mention your weakness that employer takes them in a positive way for the company. For instance;
 “ It becomes difficult to me when it comes to lying”
 “I can’t promise to show my skills in those tasks which are out of my field”
 “I can’t say no when someone asks me for help – it may happen when any senior employ ask me for help which I am not supposed to do”
But, never highlight a weakness that is a core competency of the job. Show that you are aware of your weakness and what you have done to overcome it. Expose your self-awareness and that you have the ability to take steps to improve yourself.
3.    What are your goals or where do You See Yourself In 5 Years?
This question catches a lot of job seekers off guard because on the surface it seems simple enough but when you dig a little deeper you’ll see that there are a couple of traps you could fall into.
Divide your ambition into short term and long term goals. Show them you’re ambitious, yet your decision often oscillates to and fro with respect to circumstances of life, and what situation is expected to lead you. To put in other words, you need to show that you don’t have your “head in the clouds” and are focused on the job at hand. 
After you have demonstrated your dedication to the part you are meeting for, framework a practical development methodology that is directly tied to the role you’re in and the needs and values of the company.
4.    What are three positive things your last boss would say about you?
This is the best way to boast about yourself through someone else&#39;s words: say &quot;My boss had patted on my back for showing incredible contribution at XYZZ event – he appreciated my dedication towards my team, he told me that he never saw such hardworking employee ever. He recognizes me with my responsible attitude.
5.    What salary are you seeking?
When you&#39;re asked, &quot;What salary are you seeking?&quot; it is to your advantage if the employer tells you the range first. 
Get ready by knowing the going rate in your general vicinity, and your primary concern or leave point. 
One conceivable answer would be: &quot;I am certain when the time comes, we can concur on a sensible sum. In what run do you normally pay somebody with my experience?&quot;
