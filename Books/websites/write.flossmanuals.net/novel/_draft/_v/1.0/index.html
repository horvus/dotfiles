  <h1 id="Home"><span style="color: #339966;">Troubleshooting:</span></h1>
<p>I have alway have a tough time remembering all the wonderful stuff that i have done with my system, all the hours i have wasted trying to reinstall my operation system or all the time i spent trying to fix an issue which I was the cause of, out of my experience so far i have come to realize that i could have cut my pain short, if i had a manual or a guide to help me remember what i had done to resolve certain problems previously. Alas! there is none, so I decided that I would record every problem I ever face with my system, it would atleast be useful for someone who face such problems in the future.</p>
<p>Behold the list:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1&gt; VIDEO/MOVIE PLAYS GARBLED: when there is an error in reading the data of a movie when trying to seek it starts to jitter or it comes garbled, then there is a problem with the divxg400 codec in the mainconcepts mpeg splitter, we have to disable the fastwrite capability. the file plays smoothly</p>
<p>2&gt;IF THE EXPLORER STARTS HANGING WITHOUT OPENING ANY PROGRAMS EVEN IF CLICKED ON THEM: its a problem with the screensaver settings or any kind of an illogical configuration of the system.</p>
<p>3&gt;AUTOPLAY 0F VIDEO THE SECOND TIME IS DARK: the problem is with the g400 codec we have to set it to autoplay at 25fps and load only if necessary</p>
<p>4&gt;pause in aoe3: to enable the unpausing as soon as the game is loaded we have to change the setting from [ map ("pause", "world", "pause") ] to [ map ("F7", "world", "pause") ] in the file G:\Games\Microsoft Games\Age of Empires III\Startup\game.con</p>
<p>5&gt;bluetooth requires the services: snmp service, remote registry to be running</p>
<p>6&gt;lan requires: dhcp server,dns clients and some other services</p>
<p>7&gt;whenever the pc suite gives an error that file transfer could not be initialized then check the services for bluetooth and set them to automatic and then if that fails then reinstall the software.</p>
<p>8&gt;pc tv slows down: update of video driver is the cause in may 2007 93. &amp; 91. versions only 77. works fine the problem is with the resoltion on 1024*768 at 60 htz not possible,,, only possible on 800*600 at 85 htz</p>
<p>9&gt;the ram has 49% memory used up as soon as the system starts: i think this is cos i set the bios memory to be cacheable in the bios setup</p>
<p>10&gt;Refresh rate supported by 1024*768 res in custom timing is 69 htz (69.753)</p>
<p>11&gt;If the keys start acting wierd: Its time to change the keyboard.. eg, if shortcut keys for no reason at all.. and you get a feeling that the alt has been pressed by itself... its not any packs fault</p>
<p>12&gt;In halflife 2 cd one file is missing in half-life2/root/bin/FileSystem_Stdio.dll so make a copy of the FileSystem_Stream.dll and rename it to the stdio.. the game will start but the saving and loading will get fucked the a.i will remain disabled, actually its not cos of the missing file its cos the cheats are turned on and by disabling the cheats and then pressing f6 would restart the a.i. or by editing some config file. THE VAMPIRE MASQUERADE USES THE SAME ENGINE AS HL2 SO THE FileSystem_Stdio.dll CAN BE PASTED FROM THIS GAMES DIR/BIN TO HL2/BIN (but this doesn't work)</p>
<p>13&gt;Remember, whenever a usb connection gives an error then it is a problem with the usb cable, there are no bad connections for usb or driver errors for usb in xp</p>
<p>14&gt;If pc tv is restarting the computer if clicked on the record or gallery button then the installation is fucked. Reinstall pc tv</p>
<p>15&gt;The Java editor whose batch was created by me shows a path to notepad++ dir n opens the notepad++.exe with %1.java where %1 is replaced by the file name i give by typing eg: editor caps, this opens a new .java file with name caps</p>
<p>16&gt;If the network says acquiring network address for a long time then some services are disabled or manual, specifically Routing and Remote Access tcp/ip net bios helper</p>
<p>17&gt;Acronis install error - Dont ever install Acronis products ever cos they fuck up the system very badly and they are hard to uninstall, only the boot manager can be installed but still with caution.</p>
<p>18&gt;Desktop Icons - To remove Sony Erricsson's icon from the desktop i went to the registry and searched for desktop, then eventually i came to this key</p>
<p><br />[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Desktop\NameSpace\{A5110426-177D-4e08-AB3F-785F10B4439C}]<br />@="Sony Ericsson File Manager"</p>
<p>This is the key that holds the value for the menu that comes up when right clicked so i just deleted that key and refreshed the desktop and "voila". The names of only those icons which cannot be deleted are there.</p>
<p>19&gt;The uninstall of crysis is kinda tricky but its possible to uninstall, it has something to do with .net framework1.1 i think it tries to install it but fails so gets suspended, so i tried installing .net framework1.1 seperately but wouldnt complete. I think i have to make the .net installation fail first and then uninstall crysis. But how do i do that?? or maybe uninstall crysis in safe mode.. not sure.</p>
<p>20&gt;When the mouse hovers over a video file or vcd file (.dat) then the system suddenly restarts, this is because of daemon tools 411 which has sptd layer version 1.53 in the DVD SOFT-5-3-08 The sptd does this. This problem is fixed by daemon tools lite 4123. which has sptd layer version 1.56. Always extract daemon tools to the hard disk first and then install cos, i think thats what causes the problem. Thank You.</p>
<p>21&gt;LINUX - The audio in mandriva 2008 linux has bad compatibility with my laptop with kernel version 2.6.9 so update it to version 2.6.18 and not version 2.6.19 or 23 as they have problems with the bluetooth and the video driver also, as when logging off the video goes blank or gives a corrupted color display.</p>
<p>22&gt;LINUX - To solve the problem with the video drivers for linux we have to update the video drivers, and it has something to do with the xconf file located in the /etc/xorg.conf or something like that, so always make a backup of the files and then make changes so that we can restore it if there is any problem with it. also /etc/fstab is to change the settings for mounting disks onto linux, to get write capabilities in linux we have to update linux with ntfs-3g drivers and then change the fstab with the rw and not ro</p>
<p>23&gt;LINUX - To get read and write for ntfs we need to update linux with ntfs-3g and then change the settings in the fstab to rw.</p>
<p>24&gt;LINUX - Always do changes in linux with root and not with a su but with complete login, so that the changes done are complete, sometimes the changes dont take effect if the changes are done, with a normal user login.</p>
<p>25&gt;LINUX - To install the video drivers for nvidia in mandriva it requires to install the source files for the kernel aswell as it would need to compile the kernel, as it would'nt have any precompiled kernel for linux, so if updating the kernel always also update the source files for the kernel also.</p>
<p>26&gt;LINUX - To be able to write to a ntfs file system, we have to have the ntfs-3g driver installed, and then the /etc/fstab has to be edited with the following lines for each partition mounted. /dev/sda1 /mnt/win_c ntfs-3g umask=0,nls=utf8,rw 0 0 Then we will be able to write to the ntfs partition.</p>
<p>27&gt;To install xp on the xps we have to go to the bios and then change the settings for the sata to ata if not the hdd will not get detected by the installation for xp. it says that but then again i checked online and i was able to see that it says we will need to install the drivers for the sata controller by doing the f6 while installing.</p>
<p>28&gt; IF autoshutdown v1.1 gives the runtime exception 50003 when you try to open it then the problem is with the vb6 sp6 runtime library, so update it and restart the system and it should be working.</p>
<p>29&gt;LINUX - The display seem to have a problem with any other kernel other than the version 2.6.18 which is installed right now on the laptop.</p>
<p>30&gt;In xp or vista if the copy or burn from the dvd rom has slowed down a lot then the reason is the dma transfering has been disabled, cos of a lot of read errors, so to reset that we need to reinstall the atapi channel and the dvd drive done.</p>
<p>31&gt; To enable scrin in tiberium wars we have to go into app. data profiles and then change all teh no's to 9 and the scrin campaigne will be enabled. ive downloaded a file for it too its in downloads</p>
<p>32&gt;TO INCREASE THE NETWORK SPEED - Start-&gt; Run-&gt; and type gpedit.msc 2. Expand the Administrative Templates branch 3. Expand the Network tab 4. Highlight QoS Packet Scheduler 5. Click on Limit Reservable Bandwidth and check the enabled</p>
<p>33&gt;FEAR EXTRACTION POINT - it has 2 cd's and the key is with the disk, there are two folders for crack install the crack from disk 2 only not the one from the folder crack only as it is fucked.</p>
<p>34&gt;MAGIC ISO DVD BURNER SHORTCUT - The path for the shortcut is "c:\prog files\burners\magiciso.exe" /cdburner</p>
<p>35&gt;Firefox safe mode shortcut is "c:\prog\firefox" -safe-mode</p>
<p>36&gt;LINUX - To setup linux grub again we need to use the live cd and then change the root of the file system to the one installed on the hdd with chroot command and then go into the place where there is .\install for the grub so run that. and the grub should be reinstalled</p>
<p>37&gt;LINUX - To start sql server i.e. mysql server in linux we have to type in mysql --help will bring up the help or mysql --user=root --password=freaked brings up the sql prompt. done. the password can e easily removed and setup. mysqladmin</p>
<p>38&gt;sql is not a dbms - Sql requires a dbms to work with, so in windows we have sql server 2005 ent. and in linux we have mysql which is installed by default in linux, we just need to use the mysql command (I like mysql better) sql server 2005 has sql management console or something, we have to use that to type commands we cannot use command prompt for that. I need to try though.</p>
<p>39&gt;BIOSHOCK - The crack included with bioshock is bad so replace it with the another one which i have and also rename it with -DX9 in the file name or something like that look it up in google. And also we have to update it with the 1.1 update or something</p>
<p>40&gt;NTFS3G: links http://www.google.co.in/search?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;hs=1dD&amp;q=how+to+update+the+fstab+to+write+to+ntfs&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=</p>
<p>mysql in linux<br />http://www.yolinux.com/TUTORIALS/LinuxTutorialMySQL.html</p>
<p>41&gt;WINDOWS VISTA - If you previously had Windows Vista or an older release of Windows 7 on the system where you&rsquo;re installing, you don&rsquo;t need a special program to back up drivers from the old system. Windows Vista and 7 save local copies of all drivers that you install in a folder called FileRepository, which is a subfolder of the logically named DriverStore folder. The full path, shown here, is C:\Windows\System32\DriverStore\FileRepository.</p>
<p>42&gt;FALLOUT3 - TO make fallout 3 run we have to install the windows live for windows games there is a link for it in the #readme# folder in the installers directory or else it will give an error and wont even start</p>
<p>43&gt;LINUX - If the window decorator stops working then it is a service which has to be enabled,and it should begin to work, you just need to know how to enable it you can problably do that by going to ksysgaurd in system tools. the name of the service is window decorator or something like that. just go to the terminal window and then type kde-window-decorator to start the window decorator again done.</p>
<p>44&gt;WIN7 - poor file copy performance over the network could be caused by the Wndows �Remote Differential Compression� engine. feature introduced in Windows Server 2003 and is available on all later versions of Windows. This Windows feature is enabled by default in Windows 7. so to disable it go to prpgrams and features and then turn windows features on or off and then Remote Differential Compression. (REALLY WORKS)</p>
<p>45&gt;MassEffect - The crack included with the mass effect cd will not open the galaxy map, so will need to install another one which says a crack fix for it. The crack is in the same folder of the game on the disk, it says crack fix. done.this game only plays in xp, we need to install from the play for xp disk</p>
<p><br />46&gt;HALO2 - needs a different crack to be installed from the downloads folder, and in order to play all the levels in halo2 we need to use one of the files in the cracks folder under j:\stuff\gamesaves\patches\halo2\haloactivationfix. there are instructions in it showing how to use it. its 199kb file.</p>
<p>47&gt;RedFactionGuerrilla - doesnt work in xp but works in win 7 but it keeps crashing because the crack has a problem, it crashes every 20 seconds, so need to wait for a new crack itself.s</p>
<p>48&gt;BATMAN ARKHAM ASYLUM - The crack provided with teh game also works to run the game without a problem for batman, but the second crack which i downloaded, which is 54kb makes the game run faster and smoother, and supposedly fixes so issues. so use the second crack in the folder Batman.Arkham.Updated.Crack, and also i completed the game the game runs fine untill he has to fight the poison ivy, unless you complete the game correctly, while turning the water off, and if while reloading the enemies are missing, then the whole game from there is fucked, so whenever the game starts from a checkpoint make sure that the game has the enemies loaded, or the game never ends without the saves from someone else.</p>
<p>49&gt; If NFS Shift is lagging, then you have to disable the physx engine to get a better performance, so you cant disable it just like that you need the nvphysx tweaker, download it from guru3d.com and it should fix the issue, and the tool doesnt run unless you run it in compatibility mode with windows98 in xp, havent tried in vist or 7 yet. NFS should run better in 7 i guess, try to run NFS with 3d analyse, i get much better performance, if i run it trough that almost a full range upgrade to it. and if nfs is not playing in windows 7 or is crashing then it is an issue with the settings in graphicsconfig.xml in my documents, so the settings for the shadow needs to be medium or 2 without quotes Sussed it!!! I think i know where the crash is coming from. Been messing around with graphics settings and its everytime you change the shaddow detail. If your game crashes before you can change the options (i.e you have a high end PC) goto My documents&gt;NFS SHIFT and edit the graphicssettings.xml, goto to shaddow detail and put in "2" without the quote marks. This should then sort out crashes.</p>
<p>50&gt;Splinter cell uses starforce protection so it is difficult to crack it, so the image is used to play it, but for chaos theory there is a crack available, it is in the downloads folder after 3-2-2010</p>
<p>51&gt;LINUX - in linux to edit the startup or boot options, we need to go into the /etc/rc2 or rc3 or rc4,5 whichever mode the system you are starting in and we need to change the numbers next to the file names, so if the hal daemon, is taking too long to boot then we can change the number to 99 in the list, it is usually something like 24 or 25.</p>
<p>52&gt; WINDOWS - if you are running out of disk space on the os partition and peerguardian is installed, the it could be caused by the history.db file it can go upto 20 gb file size.</p>
<p>53&gt; CNC4 - to run the game we have to allow the firewall to allow a connection to 127.0.0.1 this the loopback so that the game will run or else it will not run, recommend to run it the first time in windowed mode, so that we can see the firewall popups.</p>
<p>54&gt; Rome Total War is a version 1.0 by default the patch provided is a v1.5 so it will give an error that a file is missing, so we need to download either from game copy world v1.0 crack or install the one from rld-rtwv1.0.rar in the zap folder</p>
<p>55&gt;Prince of persia - it doesnt need a crack to play but it tries to autoupdate itself before running if that happens then it wont play afterwards, so block it with the firewall</p>
<p>56&gt;Assassins Creed2 - AssassinsCreed_2_Update.and.Crack-ASC-II-Mbb.rar. is the crack for the game, use the exe in the update folder to updated game first, and then copy the crack to the ubisoft launcher folder in the program files. to crack the game from the crack folder.</p>
<p>57&gt;Prince of persia: forgotten sands, works great with the crack (sr-popfscf-REPACK-mbb.rar) always install the game and then run the game let the firewall allow the 127.0.0.1 connection, but the dns connection, can be blocked. after the game starts.</p>
<p>58&gt; LINUX - (cannot find codec for audio format 0x6134706D) , mplayer , mplayer gui , mplayer plugin, BASICALLY THE ISSUE IS THAT THE AAC CODEC IS USED IN MP4 VIDEO FILES, BUT IT IS PATENTED(as usual, sons of pastries) SO THE OFFICIAL VERSION OF ANY PLAYER WONT HAVE THE AAC INSTALLED, NOW AS WE KNOW ALL PLAYERS USE THE XINE ENGINE TO PLAY BACK VIDEO, THERE IS A WEBSITE, OR A GROUP KNOW AS THE PENGUIN LIBERATION FRONT (PLF) WHO MAKE THE ILLEGAL VERSIONS OF THESE KINDA THINGS AVAILABLE, AND ALSO THERE IS WEBSITE(The most awesome website ever) http://rpm.pbone.net/index.php WHICH BASICALLY HAS ALL THE RPM'S EVER NEEDED, SO CAN DOWNLOAD ANYTHING FROM THERE, SOLUTION:::: WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE IS THAT WE WILL HAVE TO INSTALL THE PLF VERSION OF THE AAC CODE IN LINUX IT IS TO BE FAAC OR FAAD FAAC FOR (FREE ADVANCED AUDIO CODER/DECODER) SO WE NEED TO DOWNLOAD THE XINE-FAAD (PLF VERSION) RPM AND INSTALL IT. THATS IT!!!! RESOLVED. NOW WHATS OPTIONAL IS THAT WE CAN REINSTALL MPLAYER TO A PLF VESION AS THE THERE ARE WIN32 CODECS THAT CAN BE DOWNLOADED OFF softpedia.org (search::: w32) BY MPLAYER GUYS, JUST DOWNLOAD THAT AND THEN EXTRACT THE .tar AND PUT THEM IN /usr/lib/codecs and /usr/lib/win32 AND /usr/local/lib/codecs AND /usr/local/lib/win32 ONCE THIS IS DONE, WE WILL NEED TO REMOVE THE MDV VERSION COMPLETELY FROM THE REPOSITORY (ADD OR REMOVE PROGS) AND THEN INSTALL THE PLF VERSION, IT WOULD BE AN OLDER VERSION, BUT WILL DETECT THE CODEC IN THE FOLDERS. AS IT IS A PLF VERSION. the packages to install are the libfaac , libfaad , xine-faad , mplayer plf version , media codec pack from softpedia. some links are: <br />http://news.softpedia.com/news/How-to-Install-Multimedia-Codecs-in-Linux-39555.shtml<br />http://linux.softpedia.com/get/Multimedia/Video/w32codec-all-10127.shtml<br />http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/slackware-14/mplayer-win32-codecs-169392/<br />http://www.mplayerhq.hu/design7/dload.html<br />http://www.google.co.in/search?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=why+is+there+no+sound+for+a+mp4+file+in+linux%3F&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;gs_rfai=</p>
<p>59&gt; THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS THAT NEED TO BE INSTALLED FROM THE CD. LOT OF THINGS MISSING IN THE INSTALLATION, SO WE CAN GO TO CONTROL CENTER AND SOFTWARE MANAGEMENT, AND THEN INSTALL SOME PACKAGES WHICH ARE NEEDED.</p>
<p>60&gt; PACKAGES CAN BE UPDATED WITH RPM USING rpm -U --upgrade OR rpm -F --freshen the upgrade option removes all previous version, -F will only install if a version already exists.</p>
<p>61&gt; PLF(PENGUIN LIBERATION FRONT) CAN BE SETUP WITH URPMI (A TOOL TO UPDATE THE PACKAGES ON THE COMPUTER WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT THE DEPENDENCIES ITS A GUI IN THE CONTROL CENTER) THE WEBSITE WOULD BE (update website here)</p>
<p>62&gt; Then there's the choice between i386, x86_64, and ppc. Here's how to figure out which one you need:</p>
<p>* i386 - If you have a Pentium or Celeron (meaning any Pentium or Celeron, including a Pentium 4, Pentium M, etc.) or the original Core Duo (not a Core 2 Duo).<br />* x86_64 - If you have a Core 2 Duo, Core Solo, Opteron, Athlon 64, Turion 64, or Sempron. (This also includes the new "Intel Mac" machines.)<br />* ppc - Any modern Mac that's not an Intel Mac.</p>
<p>63&gt; starcraft2 - it runs with the provided crack, install and then copy the updates and the update.bat file from the crack folder, and then update the game, keep the ethernet cable disconnected at this time, then copy the rest of the files from the crack folder and launch the game, no errors. runs very smooth.<br />If you own StarCraft: Brood War, copy "INSTALL.EXE" from the StarCraft: Brood War CD to your StarCraft folder and rename it to "BroodWar.mpq". If you wish to play the StarCraft original missions then please copy and rename the install file from the original StarCraft CD as well, as listed directly above.</p>
<p>64&gt; MAFIA 2 - i dont have the cracked version i have the clonedvd, so its not possible to install it by just clicking on the setup icon from the dvd, it will only install steam, so i have to install teh phoenix 1.4 beta first and then extract the Mafia2.sim(not an exact name) file, trough the phoenix software and then will need to apply the crack, it may give an error the first time i launch it, but then the second time it will install the physix engine, the 3rd time will launch it. the game plays pretty smooth in the laptop. downloads needed to run game, 1. game 2. phoenix software 3.crack.<br />the game does run. the game will not launch unless the crack is installed, even if you doubleclick on the icon for the game, it will just come to the desktop. there is also another way, we need to go to CMD and there go to the game directory, and run setup.exe /extract_all (or something to that effect) TWEE_Upgrade /extract_all:D:\TWEE_Upgrade<br />1. Download the game<br />2.Download phoenix 1.2 ( not 1.4 ) go to instruments &gt; Updatecontent &gt; internet<br />3. Now go to instruments &gt; Sid Unpacker<br />4. Select the .SIM file in your downloaded content and scan it.<br />5. Select the game in top and select everything else in the other white screen. There's a button for it aswell but it doesn't take the game in top screen on my pc so. Make sure to select it.<br />6. Press Unpack! ( make a new folder blabla, unpacking can take very long )<br />7. Go to your mafia2 map and put the crack in the pc map. ( along with the Steam thingy. )<br />8. Change the date of your computer after 28 of August. You won't need this if your American.<br />9. Enjoy yourself. ( Try to get a proper crack, I use the V3 crack now but its kinda laggy somehow. Got to chapter 10 with no problems. will inform you on the rest.</p>
<p>65&gt; UltraIso - to use ultraburn, add a registry string value in hkcu-software-eazyburnsystem-ultraiso-5.0- {name} UltraBurn {value} 0</p>
<p>66&gt; PLAYONLINUX - with play on linux, i get "IndexError: list index out of range" so will need to upgrade to a version greated than, 3.3 or 3.4, needs to be greater than 3.5, i have 3.6 now.</p>
<p>67&gt; WINDOWS XP - if the system stops to recognise any of the usb devices connected to the computer, anything new, then we have to open services and then try to restart plug and play from the list, if not possible, then go into daphne, and then stop the service, "daphne will not show if it has stoppped or started, but if a usb device is plugged in, then it will make that sound for the device" i usually used to restart the computer, the theory behind it is that, i believe the service will have hung so when i click on stop, it acutally restarts the service, eventually, allowing the devices to be recognised.</p>
<p>68&gt; MAFIA - it crashes, a lot, and it sometimes just turns the screen off, and all the devices attached, cannot do anything but to restart the system, checked online, 1 way to fix the issue, could be to update to patch 1.1 and then 1,2 and also updating indeo video drivers, and then applying the crack again.</p>
<p>69&gt; MAFIA - hangs at a specific place while loading, in " A TRIP TO THE COUNTRY - CITY" but overcome the crash if you load from a previous save and then continue, im not sure why this happens, but it could be possible that the game saves that particular save corrupted, so if that save is loaded, then it will crash, but if you just keep playing, it wont, so once that saves, dont exit the game, just finish it till that stage is over, or else it will crash, and then will have to load from a previous save, which is not too bad, as it is only in salieri's bar.</p>
<p>70&gt;ASS Creed 2 - THe crack for ass creed 2 is different its a server emulator which emulates the server running so it makes the game believe that it is connecting to the ubisoft server, when its actually connecting to the loopback ip address 127.0.0.1 so the firewall must allow connection to this address but block the rest, refer to the crack documentation for more detailed info. the crack setup is on the game cd and also in the game saves folder.</p>
<p>71&gt; LINUX - by default in suse we will not be able to write to any other folders other than the home directory, as a regular user, so the same applies to ntfs partitions also, so we will have to edit the /etc/fstab file with defaults,umask=0 0 0 by removing the default values already present. everything else after ntfs-3g can be removed, we just have to put the defaults,umask=0 0 0 on it.</p>
<p>72&gt; LINUX - to connect a bluetooth device in suse 11.3 we will have to go to console and then type a few commands mv /etc/dbus-1/system.d/bluetooth.conf /etc/dbus-1/system.d/bluetooth.conf.bak<br />nano /etc/dbus-1/system.d/bluetooth.conf because we have to edit the file bluetooth.conf and we can only connect the bluetooth device in root, but once recognised or paired it is visible in all the user profiles. so then we have to update the file with the data contained in bluetooth.conf.txt in this folder. and then we can connect or pair the device, but this still doesnt solve the problem with the audio not coming from the bluetooth headset. still cannot figure that out.</p>
<p>73&gt; LINUX - in order to set the default application in suse 11.3 we have to go to the file properties and then in the general tab click on the wrench icon and then change the first application that comes up. but it tends to get a little tedious.</p>
<p>74&gt; linux - to get a list of hardware installed type "dmsg"</p>
<p>75&gt; LINUX - to install iso master do the "tar -xvf isomaster.tar.bz2" and then go to the folder and then directly do the "make" and then if you want to install it then use "make install" although its not necessary, but will not get the icons if not installed, then the folder can be deleted, but then to uninstall we will need that folder again, so extract the tar again, and then go to the folder and then do the "make uninstall" then can delete the folder.</p>
<p>76&gt; LINUX - need to install python packages to use tucan, they are listed in the readme. install xine plugins, and xine player and stuff.</p>
<p>77&gt; ANDROID - the android sdk is a part of the sdk, we cannot develop anything without installing eclipse IDE, so the things required to develop android apps on the computer is Android SDK and Eclipse and then we need to associate them together, and then to attach my phone to the computer and for the sdk to recognise it, i have to edit a special file in /etc for the file permissons, this info is available on the developer.android.com site.</p>
<p>78&gt; ANDROID - we can use any IDE either eclipse or netbeans to develop android applications, i have the netbeans setup right now as eclipse is not starting in suse 11.3 some problem with this version of ecplise</p>
<p>79&gt; JDOWNLOADER - to download jdownloader, we can download the install/run script and run it on the computer, the best way to install it is to do that, now to run the .sh file we need to use chmod +x jd.sh to make it executable and then it can be run with ./jd.sh if we are root, it is best to install it as root only, it can be installed as other user also, but i would suggest not considering the linux user settings and the level it allows other users, anyway, the first time the script is run, it installs JD and then next time its run it runs JD, if you are logged in as a user, then we have to use the sudo command, IE sudo ./jd.sh to run the JDownloader, it is installed in the root/.jd folder now, it gives an option to choose th folder to install it under, but i made a mistake when selecting so it installed it directly there which was the default, so if we try to run ./jd.sh as a user it wont run outside the folder, but if we go in the folder and do the ./jd.sh it starts installing it, so dont do that just use the sudo command, dont install as a user.</p>
<p>80&gt; LINUX - usually /usr/local is selected as the default location for installation, the tucan and isomaster both are installed there right now, but they are all over the place, there is no specific folder for them there, there is also something else installed which is bkisoft i think for reading iso files.</p>
<p>81&gt; LINUX - i have to download the jdk from a sun site and install the latest version as the inbuilt one on linux is not supported by some applications</p>
<p>82&gt; LINUX - I dont have the gstreamer plugin for mp3 installed on opensuse i can download it from fluendo.com, i have teh xine one installed though dont know from where i got it.</p>
<p>83&gt; ECLIPSE - it doesnt start in suse 11.3 comes up with a blank window, read somewhere its a problem with this particular version of eclipse.</p>
<p>84&gt; I NEED TO DOWNLOAD THE WEBPAGES FOR ALL TEH TROUBLESHOOTING I HAVE DONE FOR ANDROID, ECLIPSE, NETBEANS, AND STUFF.</p>
<p>85&gt; LINUX - POP3 - doesnt install in linux as i get a access denied message. not sure about why it does that need to find out more.</p>
<p>86&gt; LINUX - if h264 encoded files, like mkv, mp4 and stuff are not playing with full speed then there is a setting in smplayer to set under performance and says loop filter - has to be set to skip always. and the threads are 8 right now</p>
<p>87&gt; ANDROID - LINUX - NETBEANS- if my dell xcd 28 should be detected automatically on my linux box with having to do anything with anything. after installing the android sdk, so netbeans should automatically detect the device connected after setting up the netbeans for android use, but in case that doesnt happen, then the daemon for adb has stopped running and needs to be started again, so all we have to do is go into the android folder and then start adb, to do that first we have to make adb +x commands: chmod +x adb, then ./adb runs adb, then ./adb devices gives a list of devices attached, if the daemon is not started then it will automatically start it, and it should show up in the list, otherwise if no device shows up then we have to follow then instructions in the webpage for android development, i have downloaded it and also bookmarked. it gives info about some script to run.</p>
<p>88&gt; LINUX - if pulse audio keeps failing, then it is a conflict between alsa and pulse audio, there is a setting in pulse audio where it asks to make available the pulse audio devices locally just uncheck that and everything should be as smooth as butter.</p>
<p>90&gt;LINUX - in order to connect any bluetooth headphones in linux suse 11.3 i have to install teh blueman package, it is not available in the repository, but i have to manually download it and then install it in the, system, that will allow me to connect the audio headset to the system, now the sound output is a different issue all together, something for another day. i have blueman 1.21 installed right now. the headset is detected and also connects. but no audio.</p>
<p>91&gt;Lost Planet2 - to run this game the directx and games for windows live has to be updated to the latest version, otherwise it will not run even if we have directx installed so for directx run the webinstaller, as it will download only the required files or updated files from the internet. and the same with games for windows live i have downloaded the websetup and also the redist. use redist for GFWL that should be enough.</p>
<p>92&gt; LINUX - TOTEM uses gstreamer plugins to play files, and the most difficult things to play in linux are wmv files, now totem uses plugins from a particular location, I DONT KNOW WHERE EXACTLY, but if i install the gstreamer plugins which are not supplied with the os, due to restrictions, then i have to download them from http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/modules/ the bad and the ugly, then i may be able to play the files but for that again i would need to specify the path where the files are located, if i install it from source then they get installed in /usr/local/lib/gstreamer* so i have to add that path for totem to find, under command line.</p>
<p>93&gt; WINDOWS 7 - to have a shortcut for an elevated CMD: create a shortcut for cmd.exe, then right click, properties, then under general, advanced, and then check run as admin. that should give u an elevated cmd.exe. (ACTUALLY CAN BE DONE FOR ANY SHORTCUT)</p>
<p>94&gt; LTOOLS (Linux Tools, formerly LREAD) do the same under DOS, what MTOOLS do under Linux. LTOOLS are a toolset to read, write or modify files on the Linux Extended 2 (ext2) filesystem under 'foreign' operating systems like Windows or any UNIX. LTOOLS can be used from the command line or from your web browser. Instead of your web browser, you may also use LREADgui, which is a Java graphical front end for the LTOOLS. You can use LTOOLS under DOS, Windows 9x, Windows NT, LINUX (x86 or 68K) or SOLARIS. Basically it should also work under any UNIX-like operating system.</p>

<p>95&gt; WINDOWS - slmgr.vbs /dlv is used to see the status of the license slui.exe is to open the activate windows UI</p>
<p>96&gt; WINDOWS - CONTEXT MENU - 7 X64 - If 7zip or winrar is missing from the context menu, then there is a way to put it there manually, open regedt32.exe and then change permissions first, for the user give him full access. and then close that and open regedit.exe and then go to <br />HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\exefile\shell\ and then add a key with any name, i used "7z" this time, and then in the right in the default value double click default and then in the value filed enter C:\Program Files (x86)\Soft\7Zip\7z.exe a files.7z "%1" and that will give a context menu to add to archive for 7z. ***now the 7z.exe is a command line tool for 7z (7ZG.EXE IS A GUI, THERE IS ALSO ANOTHER EXE THERE WHICH I DONT KNOW OF I DINT TRY OPENING IT WHEN WRITING THIS) so the way i found out about this was to go to cmd, and then open 7z.exe and then it gave me instructions on how to add to archive with the 7z.exe. and i just put that info in the default value. now i was not able to create that info many times i tried, when i was trying to put the info into "contextmenuhandlers" entry, which is wrong. it wont take it. now if this has to be done for all file types then i will have to add these same things to HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\shell, under that i added a key, add to 7z archive... and then under that another key, command which had the default value of C:\Program Files (x86)\Soft\7Zip\7z.exe a -t7z %d.7z "%1" , i actually updated this C:\Program Files (x86)\Soft\7Zip\7z.exe a -t7z %d.7z "%1" adding the %d will give the new archive created the same file name as the files, which is awesome by the way cos i found out about it myself, no help from anything.*** help taken from these website: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/223188<br />http://maketecheasier.com/customize-the-right-click-menu-in-windows-7-injecting-extra-features/2009/12/22<br />http://www.dotnetperls.com/7-zip-examples<br />http://www.google.co.in/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=how+to+use+7zip+command+line&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;redir_esc=&amp;ei=FSNpTvinFsTwrQfh7eHoCg<br />http://www.jfitz.com/tips/search.htm<br />http://www.jfitz.com/tips/rclick_custom.html<br />http://www.google.co.in/search?hl=en&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Jh9pToTdIs6GrAfa84T8Cg&amp;ved=0CBYQBSgA&amp;q=why+can%27t+i+see+7+zip+in+the+context+menu%3F&amp;spell=1#sclient=psy-ab&amp;hl=en&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;source=hp&amp;q=how+to+put+add+to+archive+in+context+menu%3F&amp;pbx=1&amp;oq=how+to+put+add+to+archive+in+context+menu%3F&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;gs_sm=e&amp;gs_upl=369959l379833l5l380079l48l36l7l0l1l1l412l6719l0.13.12.4.1l30l0&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.&amp;fp=f083121367e034b3&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=937<br />I HAVE ALSO SAVED THE WEB PAGES TO S:\Stuff\InfoDir\SystemTutorials22-3-08\add 7z to context menu and other things********************THIS IS SOMEHOW NOT WORKING AS EXPECTED BUT SERVES TEH PURPOSE, TRY IT OUT AND U'LL KNOW WHAT I MEAN***************</p>
<p>97&gt; ANDRIOD - either after installing or uninstalling, the go sms pro or slideit keyboard the lock unlock animation started working, not sure how that happened, also at the same time i also moved, some applications to sd: couple games, pudding camera, mobo player so could be any of these things that may have caused it to begin to work as earlier i had a problem with it where it was not working even if enabled, actually i think all the animations started, the theme new year 2011 for go sms i installed it with go sms pro, now i never knew that the snow would actually fall, but now the snow started falling, on the screen, then after that in installed an old version of slideit keyboard, i thnk 2.1 and then i watned new version, so i downloaded that conected usb, and when trying to disconnect, the system froze, so i left it like that and the system restarted, and when it was back, when the screen unlocked i was able to see the animation. yesterday i had also installed rom manager and fixed file permissions from it. I THINK WHAT FIXED IT IS THE LOCKING OF THE PHONE I DISABLED THE PHONE LOCKING THE SLIDING RING, JUST TO TRY IT OUT HOW I WILL BE ABLE TO USE IT, AND I THINK THATS WHAT FIXED IT, WE NEED TO GO TO CANYOGEN MOD SETTINGS AND THERE DISABLE THE SCREEN LOCK OPTION OR SOMETHING RELATED TO THAT. :)</p>
<p>98&gt; THE WITCHER - I have some files for the witcher saved somewhere but dont know where, fisrst off. the update cannot be installed without an installfix, now its basically manually extracting the fiels to a location and then cracking it, now i have done that and that is what i wil save onto a disk.</p>
<p>99&gt; NFS THE RUN - INSTALL THE ISO, THEN APPLY THE NFSBLACKBOXFIX.RAR, OR ELSE GAME WILL COME TO A BLACK SCREEN WITH NFS ON THE RIGHT TOP CORNER, THEN EXTRACT THE FAXXFIX IN THE SAME DIRECTORY, IF THE GAME IS RUNNING SLOW, THE FAXXFIX.RAR IS IN THE INSTALLED GAME DIRECTORY. (note: game takes a long time to install)</p>
<p>100&gt; Alien Breed Impact - The Game installs correctly, but will not run, will give an error, cudart32_30_9.dll is missing, so there is another file in the Binaries folder, which says cudart.dll just rename that file to cudart32_30_9.dll and it runs.</p>
<p>101&gt; WINDOWS 7 - MAX PAYNE 3 - to change the default temp folder go to the environment variables, and then change the tmp and temp folder paths default is: %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Temp for user variables and %SystemRoot%\TEMP for system variables</p>
<p>102&gt; MAX PAYNE3 - Installation of the game takes 3 hrs, first of all make sure that the temp folders have atleast 5 gb of free space or else the installation will fail, we have to change the env. variables, to a different partition if no space on the root partition. *note* BLACKBOX game ripper uses inno setup which is a free installer wizard for windows. seems to be good. http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php</p>
<p>After trillions tries and millons of blue screen of death (bsod), i finally could played it. i got the reloaded version, it&rsquo;s like it says in the nfo, first install game then update 1.0.0.17 (launch and social updates too), then udate 1.0.0.22, create an account at social club, then crack it. when it starts you join to your account and the game begins. but i had a little trouble finding the 17 update.<br />Please SKIDROW upload the 17 patch for those who can&rsquo;t find it. And thanks!!</p>
<p>103&gt; CONTEXT MENU - Edit right click menu for Folders You can follow the same steps as shown above for folders also, it&rsquo;s just a different registry path. In order to edit the menu options for right clicking on folders, go here: HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Folder\shellex\ContextMenuHandlers\<br />You&rsquo;ll have to scroll quite a bit, but once you get there, it should look something like this: Again, you can either delete the folders under ContextMenuHandlers or you can simplt disable them by editing the key and putting a &ndash; in front of the value. Simple as that and works like a charm! Enjoy! you can add Copy To Folder and Move To Folder options to the right-click context menu. When you choose one of the options from the menu, you browse to any place on your hard disk to copy or move the file to, and then send the file there. To add the option, run the Registry Editor [Hack #68] and go to HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\AllFilesystemObjects\shellex\ContextMenuHandlers. shellex tells you it's a shell extension key that lets you customize the user shell or the interface. Create a new key called Copy To. Set the value to {C2FBB630-2971-11d1-A18C-00C04FD75D13}. Create another new key called Move To. Set the value to {C2FBB631-2971-11d1-A18C-00C04FD75D13}</p>
<p>104&gt;Assasins Creed - skullptura rip - is skippy, game doesnt play smoothly, also to install the jerusalem fix i first have to extract the files from the setup file AC_RUS_TO_ENG.EXE using universal extractor.. as i cannot run the setup and install the files for some reason it gives an error which is unreadable, once the files are extracted, just follow the instructions in the readme file. Sthe cracks in the assassins creed disk are fake they dont work, so dont copy the cracks... just install the game and play using the exe files in the game directory, the game will not launch with the launcher. The exe files in jrusalem fix are fucked. so dont apply that fix. To fix the problem with the fullscreen mode for Assassins creed, create a shortcut for the Assassinscreed_Dx10.exe and then in the target box type E:\Games\Assassins_Creed\AssassinsCreed_Dx10.exe 1920,1080, 60 where 1920.1080 is the screen resolution. ****FIX***It could help you guys out. If you're running Windows, of any version, enter My Computer, then your main hard-drive (likely C:\), 'Windows', 'System32', 'drivers', 'etc', then open the 'host' file in notepad and add these at the bottom I did as above but put these in the text document (i had to make sure I had admin rights to save the file when opened in Notepad)</p>

<p>107&gt; SYMBIAN - for mobile downloads softpedia has everything listed, and the full version downloads can be done via 4shared. :) so open both together see in softpedia and download in 4shared.</p>
<p>108&gt; ANDROID - to add android support for netbeans, we will have to search in google and add http://kenai.com/projects/nbandroid/downloads/download/updatecenter/updates.xml for the plugins to be available on netbeans, and then can use it, but google prefers the eclipse bundle, and all tutorials are given for that. and also command line ofcourse.</p>
<p>109&gt;LINUX - to fix issues with the display use the following method. :<br />Uninstall ATI driver</p>
<p>$ sudo sh /usr/share/ati/fglrx-uninstall.sh (if file is existing)<br />$ sudo apt-get remove --purge fglrx fglrx_* fglrx-amdcccle* fglrx-dev*</p>
<p>Install free driver</p>
<p>$ sudo rm /etc/X11/xorg.conf<br />$ sudo apt-get install --reinstall libgl1-mesa-glx:i386 libgl1-mesa-dri:i386 xserver-xorg-core<br />$ sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg</p>
<p>Reboot</p>
<p>$ sudo reboot</p>
<p>Download ATI driver</p>
<p>$ mkdir ~/catalyst12.6/<br />$ cd ~/catalyst12.6/</p>
<p>To know what Graphic Card you have, do lspci -v | grep -A 12 VGA<br />Download the appropriate driver for your machine here from the AMD/ATI Website .<br />File should be something like amd-driver-installer-12.6-legacy-x86.x86_64.run<br />(not version 12.4 like in previous answer, 6 monthes earlier)<br />Move it in ~/catalyst12.6/ .<br />Unzip it if needed.</p>
<p>$ unzip amd-driver-installer-12.6-legacy-x86.x86_64.zip</p>
<p>Install ATI driver</p>
<p>$ sudo apt-get install build-essential cdbs dh-make dkms execstack dh-modaliases fakeroot libqtgui4<br />$ sudo chmod +x amd-driver-installer-12.6-legacy-x86.x86_64.run<br />$ sudo sh ./amd-driver-installer-12.6-legacy-x86.x86_64.run --buildpkg Ubuntu/precise<br />$ sudo dpkg -i fglrx*.deb<br />$ sudo amdconfig --initial -f</p>
<p>Reboot and Check if installation is successful</p>
<p>$ sudo reboot<br />$ sudo fglrxinfo<br /> display: :0 screen: 0<br /> OpenGL vendor string: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.<br /> OpenGL renderer string: ATI Radeon HD 4200 Series <br /> OpenGL version string: 3.3.11653 Compatibility Profile Context</p>
<p>also try</p>
<p>see a black screen upon reboot, what do I do!?!</p>
<p>First, reboot into recovery mode, in low graphics mode. Then enter this again into a Terminal: sudo aticonfig --initial. If you see nothing again on the reboot, go back into low graphics mode to uninstall the driver.</p>
<p>How do I uninstall the ATI driver?</p>
<p>This method only works by removing the drivers and not reimplimenting the old one. Here's the tutorial to uninstall, reinstall and configure the default ATI drivers to the way it was.</p>
<p>Once again, reboot into safe mode in low graphics mode and open up a Terminal. Enter this: cd /usr/share/ati</p>
<p>and this: sudo sh ./fglrx-uninstall.sh</p>
<p>also to check if glx is installed use glxinfo or glxinfo|grep rendering to find out if direct rendering is enabled. to configure the card u can uses sudo aticonfig or amdcccle. if u are facing issues with any particular driver try command sudo update-alternatives --config &lt;command&gt; eg: sudo update-alternatives --config glx. &lt;&lt;to be able to find what files were installed like wineserver you can try { dpkg -S wineserver } that will list all the files that were installed and show the location also. &gt;&gt;&gt; u can can also try &lt;&lt; which wineserver or which glx &gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>110&gt;ANGRY BIRDS - some versions of angry birds dont start on mibook so installing an older version first and then updating it seems to work.</p>

<p><br />I solved the problem by editing the file: /etc/pulse/default.pa<br />I changed load-module module-cork-music-on-phone to load-module module-role-cork<br />The sound is back, although the sound applet is missing in mate, which is another issue.</p>
<p><br />Re: I just installed the latest version of LMDE (NO SOUND!)<br />by zerozero on Fri Dec 21, 2012 9:58 pm</p>
<p>CODE: SELECT ALL<br />su</p>
<p>CODE: SELECT ALL<br />head -n 1 /proc/asound/card0/codec*</p>
<p>is it the alc889?<br />this should work (tho is for the 887) &gt;&gt; http://www.webupd8.org/2010/11/fix-hda-intel-realtek-alc887-no-sound.html</p>
<p>lspci -v (lists all the pci devices on the system)</p>
<p>cat /proc/asound/version<br />cat /proc/asound/cards<br />cat /proc/asound/devices<br />cat /proc/asound/oss/devices<br />cat /proc/asound/timers<br />cat /proc/asound/pcm</p>
<p>(CAT GIVES INFO ABOUT DEVICES I THINK)</p>
<p>dmesg</p>
<p>To know what Graphic Card you have, do lspci -v | grep -A 12 VGA</p>
<p>you can find one list of possible options in /usr/share/doc/alsa-base/driver/ALSA-Configuration.txt.gz. Gunzip it, open with gedit and search for your soundcard chip. To check which chip you have</p>
<p>aplay -l</p>
<p>Edit /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf as root:<br />sudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf</p>
<p>And add the following line at the end of the file:<br />options snd-hda-intel model=generic</p>
<p>Save, reboot</p>
<p>112&gt; LINUX - COMPIZ FUSION - GTK-WINDOW-DECORATOR - to get compiz to load at startup put the command (compiz --replace) and for the tray icon (fusion-icon -n) -n is to load only the icon without loading a window manager.</p>
<p>sudo apt-get purge removes any left over files from the system<br /> sudo apt-get -f install installs any dependencies<br /> sudo apt-get autoremove also removes any left over files, or any partial installations and stuff.<br /> sudo dpkg -i installs stuff.<br /> ccsm (command for compizfusion)<br /> gconf-editor (a regedit type of editor for many things specially for compiz)</p>
<p>So, if you successfully messed up Compiz then you can actually reset all those value to the default ones by issuing the below commands in your Terminal. (APPLIES TO UBUNTU)<br /> gconftool-2 --recursive-unset /apps/compiz-1<br /> unity --reset</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; http://www.webupd8.org/2012/10/how-to-reset-compiz-and-unity-in-ubuntu.html &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<p><br />The instructions might not work in all cases but it can be used if you don't want to add a PPA or the method doesn't work for you.</p>
<p>Firstly, install dconf-tools:<br />sudo apt-get install dconf-tools</p>
<p>Since Compiz in Ubuntu 13.04 and 12.10 is using Gsettings (dconf), you can reset Compiz and Unity using the following command:<br />dconf reset -f /org/compiz/</p>
<p>The old "unity --reset" command used to restart Unity too, while the command above doesn't. So to restart Unity after running the above command, use:<br />setsid unity</p>
<p>You can also run the following command to see the Compiz settings you have:<br />dconf dump /org/compiz/</p>
<p>And a final note: the old "unity --reset-icons" command which resets the Unity Launcher icons to default still works with Ubuntu 13.04 and 12.10.</p>
<p><br />&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; $ cat /etc/*-release - TO FIND THE VERSION AND THE NAME OF THE OS INSTALLED. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>need to install jre and jdk from sun website first before doing anything with android tools. PHONON GSTREAMER PLUGIN AND GSTREAMER HAS TO BE INSTALLED.</p>
<p>order 2 or 4 gb pendrives to save files onto it like the dx files and gfwl .net and all, so that i will have them ready and updated. and the nvidia drivers.</p>
<p>112&gt; LINUX - INSTALLATION - DPKG - APT-GET - if any package installation fails then use apt-get -f install without any parameters to install the missing dependencies. (do it right after trying to install the package and it says failed because the installer will be there in the management list) if for any reason that fails and if there are other packages listed as missing try installing them, eventually one of them which u are trying to install will lead to the root dependency. so try sudo apt-get -f install after every package. :)</p>
<p>113&gt; LINUX - LOGIN - OPENSSL - to fix issues during login with openssl with version conflicts, you can either try to remove the openssl without removing any dependencies. or you can try a $ sudo apt-get remove --reinstall openssl if that doesnt work then you can try just a reinstall but the package to reinstall will be openssh or ssh $ sudo apt-get install ssh or $sudo apt-get install --reinstall ssh. this is how i fixed the problem. THIS ISSUE USUALLY OCCURS WHEN I DO THE aticonfig --initial THERE IS A VERSION MISMATCH. SO JUST REINSTALLING THE SSH SHOULD FIX IT, &lt;&lt;be advised that this may remove libreoffice&gt;&gt;.</p>
<p>114&gt; LINUX - VIDEO DRIVERS - after all that i have read, it seems that the best way to install the video drivers is to download the package and then install it from the AMD website, if i try to install from the .deb packages then it may cause desktop corruption is what is mentioned on the AMD website.<br />installing the fglrx drivers from the repositories is also possible, but i will have to put the experimental repositories so that i can install the latest drivers. building the packages doesnt seem to be possible for debian. if i try to install from the .run (binary) file using the text $ sudo sh amd-catalyst-13.4-linux-x86.x86_64.run --buildpkg Debian/testing [THIS SUPPOSEDLY WILL NOT WORK] i have the direct rendering working when the amd driver is not installed right now. installing the xvba-va-driver will enable the hardware accelration for mp4 files. $ sudo update-alternatives --config glx allows me to configure alternative files for glx. mesa drivers seem to be doing the trick. X -version tells me the version of the xserver that i am running. libgl1-fglrx-glx will install the glx drivers install all these first before installing the ati drivers. ALSO FOR THE ISSUE WITH GLXINFO MENTIONING DIRECT RENDERING : NO THE RESOLUTION IS TO REINSTALL THE VIDEO DRIVERS AFTER INSTALLING WINE, BECAUSE WINE BREAKS IT. THE LIBGL.SO.1 CHANGES TO MESA DRIVERS RATHER THAN FGLRX DRIVERS. To stop the screen tearing change vblank settings in compiz, and also in the catalyst center choose tear free.</p>
<p>115&gt; LINUX - WINE - Q4WINE - PLAYONLINUX - the store location of wineserver of wine on debian is /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/wine/wineserver AND /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/wine/<br />also to check if glx is installed use glxinfo or glxinfo|grep rendering to find out if direct rendering is enabled. to configure the card u can uses sudo aticonfig or amdcccle. if u are facing issues with any particular driver try command sudo update-alternatives --config &lt;command&gt; eg: sudo update-alternatives --config glx. &lt;&lt;to be able to find what files were installed like wineserver you can try { dpkg -S wineserver } that will list all the files that were installed and show the location also. &gt;&gt;&gt; u can can also try &lt;&lt; which wineserver or which glx &gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<p><br />116&gt; ANDROID - 4.3 - JELLYBEAN - how to root - the root toolkit doesnt root the nexus, so i have to do it manually, the way to do that is install a custom recovery first, i have to download it, the nexus root toolkit automatically downloads it onto the system, all i have to do is go to where it is downloaded. what i did was, i copied the file to my desktop, and renamed the custom recovery image file to twrp.img and then connected the phone to bootloader, from cmd with command: adb reboot-bootloader (for all this i have to have adb and fastboot and drivers installed for the phone, all of which can be installed with the nexus root toolkit, in other words, install it first and make use of its functions.) boot to bootloader only then will the fastboot command work, ****FOR SOME REASON openrecovery-twrp-2.6.3.3-mako DOESNT INSTALL. THE PREVIOUS VERSION OF RECOVERY openrecovery-twrp-2.6.0.0-mako INSTALLS WITHOUT ISSUES ON MY NEXUS 4 ALSO THE STOCK RECOVERY FIRST SCREEN COMES UP WITH THE ANDROID AND RED EXCLAMATION ITS NOT AN ERROR PRESS UP + POWER TO GET MENU. and then i used the command in cmd: fastboot flash recovery twrp.img that installed the custom recovery on my phone, then i booted to the custom recovery which gave me many options, i first backedup my system. i have stored it in backup folder on system. then i had to install the zip files so i chose install (if you have attempted to root the system, before then there will be a folder called !ready to root which has the zip files for supersu and busybox install supersu first and then busybox and then there is another zip file called permroot install that. that will root your phone reboot and check with supersup. then if you want you can flash the stock recovery with the stock recovery image located in the nexus root toolkit folders. thats it. also there is an option called fix permission, i think its better to do that once everything is installed. also there is a rootscript in the D:\Soft\data\Root_Files folder read that once to know the sequence to install the zip files. done. Looks like after the latest android update after version 4.3. i was not able to root using the previous recovery environment, so i had to do it automatically with the nexus root toolkit, which installed the newer modified boot and the newer recovery 2.6.3.3 which now works, otherwise i was just getting a android is upgrading message, i think i was not able to root because of the modified boot image which is necessary to be updated (no idea).</p>

<p>117&gt; LINUX - GRUB - if i modify my partitions in anyway with paragon partition manager, then im doomed, because i will not be able to boot with grub. i will have to use the live cd and then install the grub2 to be able to boot from grub, before that i will have to reset everything with disk management or easus. READ Story of how i defeated Boot Problems.txt FOR THE FULL STORY.</p>
<p>118&gt; LINUX - GTK - you may face a problem with certain applications just flashing on the screen and going back off. this is actually caused by an update done to the GTK+ this is a problem with GTK3 with certain themes. the following is the fix. Just a quick note to new people that will encounter this problem. If you are of those that like the waldorf-theme, then you should know that you don`t need to replace the entire theme. The theme contains a folder for gtk2, gtk3, openbox, xfce-notify and xfwm4.<br />You can continue to use the waldorf-theme as before, and simply replace the gtk-3.0 folder with the gtk-3.0 folder from any theme that works with the new gtk3.... That way, all gtk2-apps will look exactly as they`ve always done, and the gtk3-apps will also work, but of course, they will look somewhat different compared to what they used to with the original gtk3-theme in waldorf. How much different depends on which theme you copy the gtk-3 folder from. I myself used the gtk-3-folder from a forked version of adwaita, and edited it slightly.<br />If you want to keep your current waldorf-theme, then it`s sufficient to replace the gtk-3.0-folder within /usr/share/themes/waldorf. If you want to test it, you can use this gtk-3.0-folder: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/1dcgbhylytxcw4h/H4iAWx4bLI<br />Download as zip-file, extract the file, and as root, move the extracted folder to /usr/share/themes/waldorf...<br />PS! If you want to keep a backup of the original gtk-3.0 folder, then just rename it to "gtk-3.0_old" BEFORE you move the new folder into the waldorf theme.<br />Or of course, use the gtk-3.0 folder from any other working theme. i have saved the file in linux backup folder in my personal folders. *** on a more personal note i will install KDE after the next reinstall i dont like gnome desktop *** the way to install is sudo apt-get install kde-full (ON LMDE --- http://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?f=199&amp;t=129971 KDE 4.10.5 ----- https://wiki.debian.org/KDE)</p>
<p>119&gt; SMPLAYER2 - sometimes you may not be able to find downloads for smplayer2 with mplayer2 in windows, so you can download smplayer and use mplayer2 with it, you will have to download both seperately. from the github or mplayer2.org note: smplayer downloads mplayer along with it by default in windows, you can get it to point to another location in the options.</p>
<p>120&gt; VIDEOS - if there is any kind of narration or any unwanted sound on any of the downloaded videos then try changing the audio settings to MONO may work.</p>
<p>121&gt; Windows - to change the attributes of certain files we cant change them by simply going to properties and then unchecking it, we will have to go to cmd and then change the attributes, thats because it will be set as a system file an hidden at the same time and there is some bug in windows which doesnt allow you to change either one by themselves you have to change both attributes together, by going to cmd and using command: attrib -H-S even if you use -S-H it doesnt work. you can also create batch files to do this automatically and get to the registry to bring it up in the context menu.</p>
<p>121&gt; WINDOWS - to get to any of the run functions in windows 7 use the shell command eg: shell:sendto or shell:documents etc. in the run box or search box.</p>
<p>122&gt; WINDOWS - easus is a better pratition manager than paragon. Linux will not be able to recognize some partitions if formatted with paragon.</p>
<p>123&gt; LINUX - when in first installed LMDE 2014 before installing any video driver whenever i chose to restart the system it used to freeze after i updated the video driver it seemed to work. also i want to install wine and playonlinux on the OS, there was a particular guide that i could follow online very simple cant seem to find it now.</p>
<p>124&gt; BATMAN ARKHAM CITY - blank screen after joker pushes him out of the window, The main story is done and haven't had a problem with the cutscenes until the part after fighting Posion Ivy's goons. After you beat them all Posion Ivy gives a little 'speach' then it goes to a cutscene with Batman and the Joker. You'll get the "Please right click now or the game will stop working" message but it will just stay on the black screen and say "Loading..." in the bottom-right corner. You're screwed now! Haha! No your not. :) What you need to do is...</p>
<p>1: Create another temp folder on desktop.<br />2: Navigate to C:\Program Files (x86)\Black_Box\Batman Arkham City\BmGame\MoviesStereo<br />3: Highlight and drag these files to the temp folder on desktop...</p>
<p>*1_01.usm<br />*1_02.usm<br />*2_01.usm<br />*2_02.usm<br />*2_03_PT1.usm<br />*2_03_PT2.usm</p>
<p>4: Restart the game.<br />5: After restarting you'll have to fight Posion <a title="Back to Top" href="#Home">Ivy's</a> thugs again Then it should try and load the Batman/Joker cutscene again (when Joker kicks Batman out of a window) but it wont load!<br />6: It SHOULD cut to Batman laying on the ground (after falling from the window).<br />7: Get the to next save point, quit the game and move those files back into the BmGame\MoviesStereo folder. Even though you dont really have to cause them cutscenes are useless now.<br />8: PROBLEM SOLVED! :)</p>
<p>125&gt; WINDOWS API - when in uninstall or install anything if i get an error for """ runtime error at 224:321 SWBEM Locator server execution failed """" then it is related to the Windows management Instrumentation service which is disabled and stopped, enabling it fixes the problem, noticed when uninstalling programs with GOG games.</p>
<p>126&gt; WINDOWS AUTO FREEZE OR SHUTDOWN - IF the system keeps shutting down or freezing, then check the event logs if you have an error for WMI with the following : Details - Event filter with query "SELECT * FROM __InstanceModificationEvent WITHIN 60 WHERE TargetInstance ISA "Win32_Processor" AND TargetInstance.LoadPercentage &gt; 99" could not be reactivated in namespace "//./root/CIMV2" because of error 0x80041003. Events cannot be delivered through this filter until the problem is corrected. then you have to download and install the MS FIXIT 50688.<br />following is the link: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2545227<br />**note this error has the capacity to turn off the hard drive.</p>
<p>127&gt; SMPlayer - to get mplayer or mpv to start in 16:9 aspect ratio then, go to advanced, and under options for mplayer, specify -aspect 16:9</p>
<p>128&gt; Dragon Age Origins - increase font size by using FTG UI Mod stored in patches and mods folder.</p>
<p>129&gt; Archive - rar - zip - 7z - uniextract - winrar - freearc - sometimes winrar or winzip or any other package manager application may say that a package maybe corrupt or sudden end of archive error may come up, such packages can be opened in freearc this is one heck of a tool and is a must, uniextract also is very powerful.</p>
<p>130&gt; Adobe Premiere Pro CS6 or any for that matter - crashes if there is low disk space on C: or on the cache drive.</p>
<p>131&gt; Dragon age 2 - make sure to install patch 1.4 before playing as there is a major game breaking bug and is fixed only after 1.2</p>
<p>132&gt; Fable Anniversary - by default it installs in russian, it can be changed by going to the profile folder in the game install directory and then changing the language to english from russian, the left arrow key doesnt work in the options only the b key and the a key work.</p>
