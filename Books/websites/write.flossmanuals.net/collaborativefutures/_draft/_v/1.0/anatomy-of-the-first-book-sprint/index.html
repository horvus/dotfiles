  <html><body><h1>Anatomy of the First Book Sprint
</h1>
<h2>One programmer and six writers in a room
</h2>
<p>The first creation of this book featured 6 to 8 writers in one space working through a networked software (Booki) which was simultaneously being built. Hence the architecture for the collaboration and the content produced by it were being produced at the same time.
</p>
<p> It is difficult to over-state how difficult this could potentially be for all involved. It would be like living in a house, trying to sleep, get the kids off to school, have quiet conversations with your partner while all the time there are builders moving around you putting up walls and nailing down the floorboards under your feet. Not easy for all parties.
  <br></p>
<p>Working on adding new features and debugging code live while the people wanting to use it and are in the same room using it, is a pretty extreme environment for a programmer to work in. </p>
<p>Thankfully, we survived this particular cross-discipline collaboration between programmer and writers because the attitudes of all those involved enabled this to be a relatively stress-free environment. The generosity of spirit exhibited by all collaborators meant that this situation was not only tolerable but acceptable and even mostly fun!</p> As a result we have not only a book, but a vastly improved alpha version of the Booki collaborative authoring platform. And more importantly; a method.  <h2>The Calendar
</h2>
<p>Day one consisted of presentations and discussions.
</p>
<p>During this first day we relied heavily on traditional ‘unconference’ technologies—namely colored sticky notes. With reference to unconferences we always need to tip the hat to Allen Gunn and Aspiration for their inspirational execution of this format. We took many ideas from Aspiration’s Unconferences during the process of this sprint and we also brought much of what had been learned from previous Book Sprints to the table. </p>
<p><img src="static/IMG_3814_2.JPG"></p>
<p>First, before the introductions, we each wrote as many notes as we could about what we thought this book was going to be about. The list consists of the following:
</p>
<ul><li>When Collaboration Breaks.</li>
  <li>Collaboration (super) Models.</li>
  <li>Plausible near and long term development of collaboration tech, methods, etc. Social impact of the same. How social impact can be made positive. Dangers to look out for.</li>
  <li>Licenses cannot go two ways.</li>
  <li>Incriminating Collaborations.</li>
  <li>In the future much of what is valuable will be made by communities. What type of thing will they be? What rules will they have for participation? What can the social political consequences be?</li>
  <li>Sharing vs Collaboration.</li>
  <li>How to reconstruct and reassemble publishing?</li>
  <li>Collaboration and its relationship to FLOSS and GIT communities.</li>
  <li>What is collaboration? How does it differ from cooperation?</li>
  <li>What is the role of ego in collaboration?</li>
  <li>Attribution can kill collaboration as attribution = ownership.</li>
  <li>Sublimation of authorship and ego.</li>
  <li>Models of collaboration. Historical framework of collaboration. Influence of technology enabling collaboration.</li>
  <li>Successful free culture economic models.</li>
</ul><p>Then each presented who they were and their ideas and projects as they are related to free culture, free software, and collaboration. The process was open to discussion and everyone was encouraged to write as many points, questions, statements, on sticky notes and put them on the wall. During this first day we wrote about 100 sticky notes with short statements like:
</p>
<ul><li>“Art vs Collaboration”</li>
  <li>“Free Culture does not require maintenance”</li>
  <li>“Transparent premises”</li>
  <li>“Autonomy: better term than free/open?”</li>
  <li>“Centralized silos vs community”</li>
  <li>“Free Culture posturing”</li>
</ul><p>…and other cryptic references to the thoughts of the day. We stuck these notes on a wall and after all of the presentations (and dinner) we grouped them under titles that seemed to act as appropriate meta tags. We then drew from these groups the 6 major themes. We finished at midnight.
</p>
<p>Day two—10.00 kick off and we simply each chose a sticky note from one of the major themes and started writing. It was important for us to just ‘get in the flow’ and hence we wrote for the rest of the day until dinner. Then we went to the Turkish markets for burek, coffee and fresh Pomegranates.
</p>
<p>The rest of the evening we re-aligned the index, smoothed it out, and identified a more linear structure. We finished up at about 23.00.
</p>
<p>Day three—At 10.00 we started with a brief recap of the new index structure and then we also welcomed two new collaborators in the real-space: Mirko Lindner and Michelle Thorne. Later in the day, when Booki had been debugged a lot by Aco, we welcomed our first remote collaborator, Sophie Kampfrath. Then we wrote, and wrote a bit more. At the end of the day we restructured the first two sections, did a word count (17,000 words) and made sushi. </p>
<p><img style="width: 459px; height: 556px;" src="static/IMG_3831_2a.JPG"></p>
<p> After sushi we argued about attribution and almost finished the first two sections. Closing time around midnight.
</p>
<p>Day four—A late start (11.00) and we are also joined by Ela Kagel, one of the curators from Transmediale. Ela presented about herself and Transmediale and then we discussed possible ways Ela could contribute and we also discussed the larger structure of the book. Later Sophie joined us in real space to help edit and also Jon Cohrs came at dinner time to see how he could contribute. Word count at sleep time (22.00): 27,000. </p>
<p>Day five—The last day. We arrived at 10.00 and discussed the structure. Andrea Goetzke and Jon Cohrs joined us. We identified areas to be addressed, slightly altered the order of chapters, addressed the (now non-existent) processes section, and forged ahead. We finished 2200 on the button. Objavi, the publishing engine for Booki, generated a book-formatted PDF in 2 minutes. Done. Word count ~33,000.
</p>
<h2>Original Collaborators </h2>
<p>The starting 7 included:
</p>
<p> <strong>Mushon Zer-Aviv</strong> is a designer, an educator and a media activist from Tel-Aviv, based in NY. His work explores media in public space and the public space in media. In his creative research he focuses on the perception of territory and borders and the way they are shaped through politics, culture, networks and the World Wide Web. He is the co-founder of Shual.com—a foxy design studio; ShiftSpace.org—an open source layer above any website; YouAreNotHere.org—a dislocative tourism agency; Kriegspiel—a computer game based on Guy Debord’s Game of War; and the Tel Aviv node of the Upgrade international network. Mushon is an honorary resident at Eyebeam—an art and technology center in New York. He teaches new media research at NYU and open source design at Parsons the New School of Design. He can be found at Mushon.com
</p>
<p> <strong>Mike Linksvayer</strong> is Vice President at Creative Commons, where he started as CTO in 2003. Previously he co-founded Bitzi, an early open data/open content/mass collaboration service, and worked as a web developer and software engineer.

<p><strong>Aleksandar Erkalovic</strong> is renown internationally in the new media arts and activist circles for the software he has developed. He used to work in Multimedia institute in Croatia, where he was the lead developer of a popular NGO web publishing system (TamTam). Aleksander has a broad spectrum of programming experience having worked on many projects from multiplayer games, library software, financial applications, artistic projects, and web site analysis applications, to building systems for managing domain registration. Aleksander was for a long time the sole programmer for FLOSS Manuals and is now leading the development (together with Adam Hyde and Douglas Bagnall) of a new GPL-licensed type of collaborative authoring and publishing platform called ‘Booki’. Aleksander’s new media artistic collaborations have won many awards, as well as being extensively exhibited internationally. Aleksander also organises creative and educative workshops directed to young people, experts, and amateurs that are interested in the software he has developed and free software in general. He is currently also employed by Informix in Zagreb, Croatia.
