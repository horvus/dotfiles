<p>I used to use <a href="http://fvwm.org">fvwm2</a>,
and tuned my desktop design very carefully to get maximum use out
of the screen space. (Now I use GNOME + Sawfish, which is
just as effective but harder to bundle up a configuration for). You
may find it useful if:</p>

<ul>
<li>You use a monster monitor capable of 1600x1200 or better.</li>

<li>The main thing you want from your X is as many lines of Emacs
buffer as can fit on the screen without causing eyestrain.</li>

<li>You like to have your key tools (xterm, Emacs, web browser) on
a handy but unobtrusive toolbar along with biff, a clock, and a
load meter.</li>

<li>You like to overlap windows as little as possible so you're not
distracted by panel-shuffling when you change windows.</li>

<li>You find using virtual desktops tends to leave you disoriented
and wondering why everybody thought this was a neat feature.</li>

<li>You don't need your desktop to make a fashion statement -- you
want a spare, clean design that gets the job done.</li>
</ul>

<p>Eric's Big Blue-Steel Desktop is basically designed to treat
your screen as a two-page display, with Emacs on the right and a
couple of xterms (or a Web browser) and the toolbar and icon dock
on the left. Font sizes are carefully chosen to be as large as can
be consistent with this layout.</p>

<p>You can view a <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/fvwm2/bluesteel.png">full-sized 1600x1200</a>
screen shot or a <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/fvwm2/bluesteel2.png">half-sized 800x600</a>
screen shot. Thanks to compression and a lot of solid-color areas,
both are small (less than 80K). Note: these are PNG images; if
they're broken, get a <a
href="http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/pngapbr.html">browser that can
view PNGs</a></p>

<p>Here is the <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/fvwm2/fvwm2rc">.fvwm2rc</a> file that sets it up.
It has been commented, with relevant X resource settings explained,
so you'll find it relatively easy to modify. Here is the .xinitrc I
used with it.</p>

<pre>
# Set up the X desktop
#
# The screen background
xearth -pos "orbit 3 70" -bigstars 20 -gamma 2.6 -label -nomarkers -night 15 &amp;
#
# The window manager.
fvwm2
</pre>

<p>If you find you like this design, either as-is or as a basis for
your own hacks, <a

drop me a line</a>.</p>

<p>(I still use a very similar layout under GNOME).</p>
